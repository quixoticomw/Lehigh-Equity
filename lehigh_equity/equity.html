            <h2>Equity Statement</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="equity">	Within a gender equitable world, there is workplace equity. Both men and women would have the same pay, chances, and treatment. In terms of pay, the National Partnership for Women and Families collected that, “women were typically paid just 77 cents for every dollar paid to a man - adding up to a difference of $11,782 over the course of the year,” in 2021. Equal pay and equity should be warranted regardless of gender.

            <br>
            Starting at a relatively young age, women tend to be led down more ‘feminine’ careers. Personally, as a young girl interested in math and science, I was encouraged to be a teacher as the boys around me exclaimed that they were going to be engineers. Regardless of gender, students should get equal exposure and chances to find interests in many fields of study. Later on, it may allow for an easier time at finding a career path they’d enjoy as well as having better overall satisfaction with a career that aligns with their known interests and talents.

            <br>
            If our education system enforced a lack of clear workplace gender roles and made resources for career-related learning more widely available, students might learn what they personally enjoy earlier on and easier. In terms of computer science, young girls tend to lack the resources and role models, possibly steering them away from the field altogether. Although each career isn’t for everyone, students deserve access to the resources if they do take interest in skills/career paths.

            I’d like to reiterate that this website was built using free resources that I’ve found on my own. I truly believe that more students would pursue learning to code if they were exposed to it more. I’ve often had others looking over my shoulder saying, “I’m not smart enough for that,” but these were the same students that have never had the chance to try. The allowance of an attempt may be the thing that changes someone's outlook on a skill or even a career. In my case, I did learn that I loved the process of learning to code.

            Creating a more welcoming environment can make a world of difference in terms of creating an equitable workplace.
