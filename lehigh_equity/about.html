                    <h2>Introduction to CompSci</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>My first exposure came from when I had joined my first computer science class completely by accident. It wasn’t the most up-to-date, but I was handed a book on HTML5 and CSS3 from 2011. It gave me a taste for what coding was like and I learned that I wanted to continue practicing it. Even if an introduction isn’t ‘high quality’, it still provides exposure to something new!</p>

                    <p>For anyone else that may want to learn, a great free resource is <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freecodecamp.org</a>! It’s a great resource to start out with as it’s segmented into small lessons!</p>
