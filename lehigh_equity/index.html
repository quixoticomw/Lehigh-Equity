                    <br>
                    <p>I am a woman entering a STEM field: computer science. I've taught myself a decent amount of HTML and CSS as well as doing illustration. I've been accepted into Lehigh and committed to being a part of the class of 2027! </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The intention of this website is to display what free resources can allow people to accomplish. Sure, this isn't the most high-end website, but it does function! Within a few weeks of searching and learning, I can present to you something that functions. Accessible and free resources are important to learning. Making them more available to everyone is important for closing gaps and allowing students to find new interests - or even careers. </p>
